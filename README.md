<h1>Miscellaneous Additions</h1>
<p>Have you ever wanted to play minecraft with a light-weight mod, that still feels like vanilla, but has some upgrades
    to it?
    Because now, you can!
    <br>Miscellaneous Additions is a fabric mod that adds random things to the game and also changes some stuff.
    <br>
    <br>This mod currently adds: <br><strong>Battleaxes, Crushed Diamond, a lot of music discs, Corn (yes, popcorn
        too:),
        Sweet Berries Cookie, Copper Doors & Trapdoors (but different), End Relay, Gunpowder Barrel, Citrine (geode
        too),
        Azalea Wood set, Golden chain, lantern and soul lantern, Redstone & Lapis equipment, Golden Chainmail armor,
        crafting of Chainmail Armor and modifies crafting of cookies & cake and also equips Trader Llamas with chest and
        loot (so they are not that useless).</strong>

    <h1>End Relay</h1>
    <p>End Relay is a very reliable way to travel in the End. This block works like a waystone, so this is a perfect way
        of
        travelling in the End.<br>Oh, and don't forget that it explodes in any other
        dimension!<br><br>This is an idea by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kenadianthecatboy">Kenadain The
            Catboy</a>.

    <h1>Battleaxes</h1>
    <p>Battleaxes are an interesting addition to the arsenal, offering significant damage. However, their strength
        comes
        at the cost of an extended charging time. If this is not enought, there's also a 1 in 15 chance that a
        struck opponent will be momentarily blinded for one second. The
        balance
        of power and risk makes wielding these battleaxes a great tactical choice.</p>

    <h1>Music Discs</h1>
    <p>New music discs made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LaudividniYT">Laudividni</a> and <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/@TenM">T_en_M</a> are waiting for you, scattered all across the three
        Minecraft
        dimensions. <br>These discs are a small fun collectible additions to the game and they also sound better than
        the
        vanilla ones, so I recommend throwing a party with them!</p>

    <h1>Redstone & Lapis equipment</h1>
    <p>Redstone and Lapis equipment is upgraded netherite. These equipments do, what is characteristic for the material
        they
        are made out of. For instance lapis is a magical armor providing more luck when enchating and the redstone one
        does
        bonus damage, when it's charged.</p>
